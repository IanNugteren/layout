                <p>A minute watching a kid run can speak volumes about how much anime they consume.<iframe width="300" height="190" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJzivIZl5Co" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="yt"></iframe> <img src="naruto.png" alt="" class="naruto"> Are their  arms thrust out behind them?   Is their head down, their back bent over, their legs churning along a diagonal axis? And are they wearing a headband with a swirly metal thing.    
                If so, that kid is running the Naruto run. And across the country over the next month, you’ll see a lot of grown-ass adults doing it, too, at any of the dozens of Naruto run events that have cropped up on Facebook.    
                Naruto is an insanely popular anime about a ninja who dreams of becoming the best. But nevermind that; even if you’ve never seen Naruto, you probably remember one very intense person in your high school who used to run like the kid ninja. On the track course? Naruto run. On the way to class? Naruto run. Getting from school to their mom’s car? Naruto run.
                I used to dunk on that kid. But you know what? That kid was doing them. And now, that kid’s grown up and moved to cities like New York, Montreal, Ann Arbor and Boston where, over the next month, they are organizing Naruto runs, often with over a thousand interested attendees each. </p>
