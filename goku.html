                <p class="small">     
                 Dragon Ball Super has revealed a new fighter that will be entering the Tournament of Power, and suffice to say, it's a fighter the likes of which we've never seen before!
                        
                Named Damom, this alien character from Team Universe 4 was revealed in a Dragon Ball Super Calender for 2018, in which we see various Universe 4 warriors sketched into the calendar artwork, including Damom!
                        
                (MILD SPOILERS Follow)
                        
                A bit of digging reveals that Damom is a "cicada insect warrior" who has a unique ability: he can turn himself invisible, utterly undetectable by most beings. We also learn that Damom won't be rolling alone: his twin/teammate Gamisaras will also be hiding on the sidelines of the Tournament of power. Gamisaras is said to be a purple cicada insect warrior, so keep an eye out for scans and artwork of him, as well!
                        
                 As you can see from the design, these cicada insect warriors look like humanoid insects, that have brightly-colored eyes and antenna, with fingersless hands that resemble boxing gloves. We don't yet know what special power they have besides the cunning and guile of their invisibility techniques; but with the word "warrior" in their name, you can bet there's some kind of formidable battle technique that Dragon Ball Super will eventually reveal.
                        
                 Meanwhile, Dragon Ball Super fans are getting ready for Goku's big battle with Universe 11's Jiren, and the long-awaited reveal of Goku's new transformation, which results from that battle. There's also a big twist coming that could shake up the entire show.</p>
